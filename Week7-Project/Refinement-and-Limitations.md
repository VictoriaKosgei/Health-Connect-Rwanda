# HealthConnect Rwanda – Refinement and Limitations Record

## 1. Purpose

This document records the limitations and refinement considerations identified during Week 7 testing and validation.

## 2. Financial Data Limitation

The billing and appointment relationship contains unmatched records.

- 60,000 billing records were available.
- 5,000 appointment identifiers matched.
- 55,000 billing records were unmatched.
- 1,000 distinct appointment identifiers were not found in the appointment table.

### Implication

Department-level financial reporting is restricted to revenue that can be allocated through matched appointment records.

The unmatched records require further investigation and reconciliation.

## 3. Resource Utilization Limitation

### Beds

The available bed data contained 2,000 records marked as Available.

This does not provide enough information to calculate actual bed occupancy or utilization.

### Rooms

The available data did not provide reliable room occupancy history.

### Equipment

The equipment records did not contain sufficient usage or downtime information to calculate actual equipment utilization.

## 4. Attendance Analysis

Attendance and no-show rates remain subject to confirmation using the actual appointment status data.

Appointment types must not be confused with attendance outcomes.

## 5. Predictive Model Limitation

The Data Science track reported that the emergency-risk model did not meet its release requirements.

The model should not be deployed until the target definition and underlying data-quality issues have been addressed.

## 6. Dashboard Refinement Review

The dashboard's tested slicers, KPI cards, cross-filtering and page navigation were reported to work as expected.

No additional dashboard redesign or visual changes are recorded in this document unless supported by separate refinement evidence.

## 7. Outstanding Issues

1. Reconcile unmatched billing records.
2. Confirm attendance and no-show status values.
3. Improve the completeness of admissions and attendance data.
4. Investigate the predictive model's target definition and data dependencies.
5. Obtain reliable occupancy and equipment usage information.
6. Confirm whether further dashboard refinements are required.

## 8. Week 8 Considerations

Week 8 should focus on:

- Resolving outstanding data-quality issues where possible.
- Completing attendance analysis.
- Confirming cross-track testing outcomes.
- Reviewing the final dashboard and business recommendations.
- Preparing the final integrated project presentation and submission.

## 9. Conclusion

Week 7 testing identified important strengths and limitations in the HealthConnect Rwanda solution.

The dashboard interactions and several analytical measures were validated. However, unmatched billing records, incomplete resource-utilization information and predictive-model limitations remain important considerations for the next phase.
